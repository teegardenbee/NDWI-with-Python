# NDWI-with-Python
This script utilizes the rasterio library to calculate the NDWI of a raster image.
The Raster was downloaded from USGS Earth Explorer. It is from the Landsat 8 satellite

NDWI stands for Normalized Difference Water Index. It is a remote sensing index that measures the water content in vegetation and water bodies
NDWI is calculated using the formula: NDWI = (NIR â€“ SWIR) / (NIR + SWIR).
The formula produces values ranging from -1 to 1.
Higher values indicate higher water content
